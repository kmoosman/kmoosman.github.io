*Break, fix, repeat. *

This has been my mantra the past month as I live and breath those three little words every day. 

I spend so much time with 'Break' I often wonder if we've gone exclusive and left the other two behind. 

Watching your code break is one of the most infuriating feelings on the planet. And when tackling a new concept it can be downright discouraging. 

However, I've learned over time just how important and necessary it truly is. When my code breaks, all the magic is gone and I get to peek behind the curtain to learn the trick. Learning the how and the why really helps reinforce the concepts and helps me retain them.

Oh, and did I mention that moment when your code finally works?

Sweet, sweet victory!

Learning ruby has bought me a million of these little moments and I'm truly starting to love the language. 

I had a love-hate relationship with Ruby when I first started the labs. I began coding with Swift and Javascript, so writing a method without curly brackets about blew my mind.

And what do you mean everything has a return value, who said that was okay?!  

However,  it's grown on me little by little every day. It's so convenient and quite frankly just gets out of your way. A few short lines of code and it does exactly what I expect. 

I'm glad I hit this point by the time I got to my project, which I've really enjoyed. I learn best by coding scenarios or examples I may use out in the "real world". So I've found it a bit tricky at times to relate to the labs. 

For my project, I decided to gather a list of all the road racing courses in the United States that I could use to query and compare data between the tracks. I've worked in Motorsports for over 10 years, so this was an exciting project for me and it was easy to follow the break, fix pattern knowing exactly what I wanted my end result to be. 

I'm very satisfied with my final project and I'm excited to come back to it at a later date to add additional functionality.
