What life taught me about coding and coding taught me about life. 

The past 6 months have been one hell of a journey. As finally learn to embrace the chaos instead of focusing on my shortcomings, I’m choosing to share this journey openly as it’s been hard, really hard but it’s taught me valuable lessons about resilience, perseverance and good old fashion grit. 

A mere 6 months ago I had the whole world in my hands. I had a partial scholarship for FlatIron, was living in my dream home designed and built from the ground up, a full life, committed long-term relationship and 2.5 dogs. The one thing that was missing, was my dream job as software developer and here I was about turn those dreams into reality. Fast forward 6 months later, I’m writing this article, living out of a camper in Temecula CA, with my whole life packed up in the back of my car, coping with the death of a loved one and scouring the internet for an apartment on a speedy 0.5 mbps internet connection. Life has a funny way of humbling us. 

The very day I went part-time at work and started FlatIron, my world was flipped upside down. In a careless instant my relationship of nearly 4 years was tossed to the wayside and I was spending my first day of the bootcamp alone, lying on my closet floor, soaking my poor dog in tears. In that moment I had two choices, I could let this crush me and my dreams of becoming a developer or I could buck up, pick up the pieces, turn a new page and refuse to give up. I chose the latter. 

As I was now supporting myself on a part-time paycheck, minus the monthly bootcamp tuition- I didn’t exactly have much to get by on. This meant, in order to continue the bootcamp I now needed to sell my house, as there was no way my part-time pay check was going to support my dream home’s mortage. So, the next few weeks I spent my days working, my nights coding and any spare second in-between packing, listing and showing my house. I sold everything I owned the wouldn’t fit into the back of my car and on Feb 15th I signed my closing docs and hit the road. 

I thought this was the end to my chaos but it was only the beginning. Over the next few months, I’d find myself in 5 new cities, on-board 12 flights, driving over 5,000 miles across the country, transitioning through an unexpected but exciting acquisition at work, finding new love then watching him leave as he deploys overseas and most recently learning to deal and cope with the unexpected passing of my grandmother as I hit the road once more to move closer to family. 

Life’s been a bit unpredictable to say the least but after beating myself up for months about my slow progress in the bootcamp I’ve decided to embrace the chaos. As I turn in this final project for rails that I’ve picked up and put down a couple times the past few days, I’m reminded soon as I return to my editor, it’s all still there. That regardless of the ups and downs life brings or whatever pesky bug in your code you’ve been banging your head against for days, stepping away can bring you a new insight and perspective. Everything will be right where you left it when you return. It’s never too late to pick back up and and continue pressing forward. 

So all in all - sure, I had a grand plan to be done with the bootcamp and on to my first programming job already. But this crazy journey as taught me far more than that ever could. It’s taught me I can do hard things. That a little bit every day counts and to never give up on your dreams. So, cheers to a few crazy stories and the adventures, heartbreak and chaos that will make graduation day so much more satisfying. 

I'll wrap this post up with a few lessons I learned while creating the Garage Rental App
* **Pay attentino to relationships!**
 I spent hours trying to track down why my objects would save... *the culprit was improper mapping of relationships in my models.*
* **Don't get hungup on the design. **
*I wasted alot of time in the beginning tweaking my css because I couldn't get something to look just right, before I had the core functionality of my App built. This is backwards. Lay the groundwork, then come back later. It was a breeze once I had everything wired up. *
* **When in doubt restart your server** 
*If you're positive your code "should" be working and it's not. Stop banging your head against the table and restart your server.*
* **Don't be afraid to pivot** 
*I started with 3 models and designed my project around that. Then I met with Kevin to talk about my project and he helped me see a bigger scope that added another model but it also helped future proof my app to continue to build upon it. I was nervous to deviate from the path I had already started down but I'm so glad I did, I came out with a much better project in the end*
