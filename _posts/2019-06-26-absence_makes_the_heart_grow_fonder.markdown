The story of how I fell in love with Ruby on Rails, the real MVP (not to be confused with MVC, its main gig) ðŸ˜„. 

When I first began the bootcamp, I wasn't sure how I felt about Ruby. I was missing all my curly brackets and parens from the languages I first learned to code in (Swift & Javascript). But I pressed forward and as I progressed through the lessons I came to love its simple and straightforward sintax. 

However, I didn't appreciate just how great it was until my final project. I did the last two projects of the bootcamp in reverse order. I followed the lessons in order but decided to wait until the end for the projects. I've found, I learn best when I create something of my own and I really wanted to finish off the bootcamp by wrapping up my learnings spending my efforts dedicated on projects to really drive the material home. 

After spending so much time with Ruby on Rails, jumping over to React, Redux and Rails really made me appreciate erb and the whole Ruby on Rails environment. React and Redux are certainly powerful and once you get everything hooked up and in the right places, it's pretty seemless. 

However, as I hammered out the final project, I often found myself scratching my head and trying to determine the best way to handle and pass around the data. I was satified with the final project and I can see so many powerful ways to use React.js and Redux but once I made it back to my Rails and Javascript project - it was all over. 

How does the saying go "You don't know have until it's gone"? Popping back over to erb, my project quickly came together and I felt like I was running back at full speed again. Everything flows together so seemlessly and it truly makes it feel like an effortless process. 

Pairing it up with an API backend was the icing on the cake, which is also smooth sailing thanks to those handy seralizers. 

So after all the lessions, 5 projects and 6 months later - I think I can finally admit, I sure do love Ruby! 

I'm so grateful for this bootcamp and all I've learned throughout it. I can't wait to use these skills in my first developer role and can't believe people actually pay us to do this for a living. This truly is my dream job and as I wrap up the bootcamp I have to give a big thank you to Flatiron for helping make it a reality.
