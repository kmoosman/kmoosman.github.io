Today I opened a fortune cookie and inside on that tiny slip of paper I found, 'Your seemingly lofty dream will come true'. How fitting as I prep this weekend for the review of my final project. 

As I finish up the bootcamp, I thought I'd bring it full circle and write about why I chose programming in the first place. Computers and programming have always interested me from a young age. However, I never in a million years thought I could be a developer. 

I grew up in a small town and the school I attended didn't have many options for programming. Pair that with the fact I'd never even met a developer until I was in my early 20's and I certainly had never encountered any female programmers.  So when it came time to pick a major in college, I honestly, was far too intimedated and embarrassed to admit I wanted to be a developer. I figured that was the equivalent of saying I wanted to be a rocket scientist and quite frankly, just didn't think I was smart enough for that. 

I actually remember sitting in a session with my academic when she asked what I'd like to do. I told her about my interest in computers but I was so intimidated when she asked about programming that I immediately backtracked and fell back to my comfort zone which was business, numbers and excel. So, I walked out of her office declaring my major as Management Information Systems instead of pursuing a CS degree. 

That was my first strike stepping up to the plate. But let's be honest, wasn't really even in the box at this point. 

However, that dream always still lingered in the back of my mind and it'd pop up occasionally to make an appearance. I remember one day specifically when I was about 19 or so and I had a co-worker ask me what my dream job would be. I told them it would be to develop software like "MSR or Veritix" which were two programs we frequently used. But I quickly laughed that off, like I said - that in no way shape or form felt obtainable. So I went for the "Shoot for the moon, land among the stars' philosophy and said I'd like to do customer service for them instead. 

Shortly after that, I actually decided to send a message to MSR and inquire about any openings with that exact intent. They didn't have any openings at the time (and were only a 4 person team - including the founders), so we kept in contact and ~4 years after I originally reached out a position opened up and I joined their customer success team. 

Now I'm officially in the batter's box but still far to intimidated to admit my interest in programming. So I kick one foot out and take a couple test swings for a few years. I'd bring up my interested in programming and mention I'd like to pursue it but every time I tried to learn on my own, I'd get overwhelmed - not knowing where to start and I'd give up. 

I was stuck in that vicious circle for years until I finally one year decided to set a new years resolution to publish an app to the app store. I didn't care what it took and how little I knew, I was going to learn along the way. I made that resolution Jan of 2018, stayed up every night until 4am teaching myself to program while working full time and I published my first iOS app to the App Store April of 2018. 

After that, I was officially hooked and determined to do whatever it takes to become a programmer and do this for a living. It was shortly after I published the app, I came across FlatIron in a Women Who Code group. I applied, got in and now here we are a week or two away from graduation! 

I wished I'd had the confidence to pursue my dreams when I was younger and first had the interest. But I'm grateful for FlatIron for helping me make this a relaity - even if I decided to tackle it a few years later. Programming is a true passion of mine and my dream now, is to pay it forward and help young women and young girls realize and pursue their dreams. So they know it is achievable, they ARE smart enough and they can do it. 

Once I complete the bootcamp, I am joining of development team at MSR so it seems my "seemingly lofty dream is about to come true". :)
